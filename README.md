# Road-alert
Web project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide users with real-time road incident and traffic information. The application integrates with the Mapbox API, a powerful mapping platform, to display interactive maps and gather relevant data for users.

By leveraging the Mapbox API, the application can dynamically render maps with zooming, panning, and interactive features, allowing users to explore different regions and locations. The API provides access to a vast array of map styles, markers, and overlays, enabling the application to visualize road incidents and traffic information effectively.

The primary function of the application revolves around collecting and presenting road incident and traffic data to users. Using JavaScript, the application retrieves real-time data from various sources, such as traffic APIs, government databases, or crowd-sourced platforms. This data includes information about accidents, road closures, construction zones, and other incidents that may impact traffic flow.

The collected data is then processed and displayed on the map using markers, symbols, or color-coded overlays, providing users with a clear visual representation of road conditions. Users can interact with the map to view specific incidents, access additional details, and obtain alternative route suggestions to avoid congested areas.
